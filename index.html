		<h2>February 24</h2>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<p><em>How is it February 24 already? Time flies!</em><p>

		<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>While I am not necessarily one to adhere to a strict schedule, getting up at 5am (okay today 6am) seems to be a good time to work on projects that require thought and free-flowing creative energy. I tried this yesterday, and within minutes was starting to work on the first Pomes Extension at last.</p>


		<h3>Inspiration</h3>
		<p>When asked what inspired her work, Sandra Boyton's response was "Curiosity."</p>


		<h3>Tech Successes and Challenges</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Managed to open the images from Feb. 23 in Photoshop. Tried to resize them without much success. Maybe should use Lightroom still in the short-term. But it's a start at least!</li>
				<li>Successfully used Chrome Developer tools to find an error in my CSS file! (The small things...)</li>
				<li>Hmmm... I'm not sure why I can't add padding between the photos from my February 23 post. Will have to revisit this. Well this and layout issues with photos and columns, etc.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3>Resources</h3>
		<p>This past January I attended two lectures at Lamont on Data Visualization: one on D3.js and the other a more general introduction. As a follow up to this, the organizers and presenters graciously sent along this <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/eabdgmde15/Handout-DataVisFundamentals2016.pdf">pdf</a>with links to various resources.</p>

			<h3>Notes</h3>
		
			<p>As I am feeling a bit uninspired at the moment, I figured maybe I'd start by trying to liven up the colors here a bit with a sort of retro/beach inspired palette: turquoise, black, white, coral (#DB5844); and a sort of dusty rose (?) (#AD403F), and the fonts to Clicker Script and EB Garamond.</p>
			<p>Now all I need is a <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/ultra-lounge-sampler-mw0000611983"> little music</a> to go with it... <em>And yes, I do have this album... somewhere... I bought in Montreal once upon a time, back in days the long since past of Spider-bird Halloween costumes...</em></p>

			<h3>Pomes and Projects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Random Thought:</b> One thing that is missing is a calendar my husband just told me... So since I'm in the process of trying to pick out photos for the Pomes Extension and other projects why not make <a href="http://www.adoramapix.com/app/products/calendars/">one</a>? <i>Another side project???</i></li>

				<li><b>My Project (if wedding 'album'):</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Music, musical notes, hearts, purple, friends, family</li>
						<li>Invite: animation of two of them in a boat</li>
						<li>After the event: Beat Brasserie</li>
						<li>To do: look at wedding alburms, talk to them again about this</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><b>My Project (travel alburm):</b>	
					<ul>
						<li>Theme: traveler, explorer, old school globe... At the same time the content and the page are dynamic, so should go together...</li>
						<li>To do: Now that the files are in a remote semblance of organization (and ongoing project!) it's probably time to get to work on chosing which ones to work with...</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><b>Journal:</b>	
					<ul>
						<li>Try mixing up the typefaces</li>
						<li>Work on layout: floats, clears, scrolling</li>
						<li>Maybe change up the colors again</li>
						<li>Link back up photo from February 16. My desktop, external drive, and desktop reorganization adventure last night lent itself to a few accidenal casualties evidently...</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Tech Challenges and Successes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I started to organize my photos last night. Wish I tagged and rated them as I went along. But can start with 2016 and work backwards...</li>
				<li>Hmmm... I also think it's going to be necessary to set definitive 'work' hours at home (maybe 3am to 7am?)... or start going elsewhere to get anything done!</li>
				<li>Still need to try out the developer tools in Chrome. Maybe tomorrow... or if I can't sleep... which ever comes first...</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Design elements I like...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unique themes</li>
				<li>Overt simplicity, yet hidden complexity</li>
				<li>Creative use of typefaces</li>
				<li>Not too much of one thing (too many typefaces, too many images)</li>
				<li>Text is easy on the eyes (no squinting required!)</li>
				<li>Selective use of overlays</li>
				<li>Colors that fit the theme and mood</li>
			</ul>

				<p>In the spirit of love... wondering if another option for the final project might be to make a wedding album for my friends Chris and Tom. Since I took the photos, and can gain access to the photos/video that others took, I think I have plenty to work with. Plus they would LOVE it!</p>
