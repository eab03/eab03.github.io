		<h2>March 3</h2>
		
		<h3>Tech Successes and Challenges</h3>
		<p>Ughh! Having more issues with both computers and just choosing photos! The iMac needs to go see a Genius and my laptop and drive are in a stand-off at the moment.</p>
		<p><em>Ke garne?</em> (A phrase in Nepali that literally translates 'What to do?' but is a bit more complex than that.) While there's little I can do about these capricious machines, I can however venture over to the Computer Lab (fun times!) at some point between this afternoon and this weekend, and then print out small card-sized copies of my favorite images (at ummm... an undisclosed location) and go from there. This actually has been my best approach to any project involving more than a few photos in the past... so I guess that says something.</p>


		<h3>Projects</h3>
		<h4>MY PROJECT, ET. AL.</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Photo Selection:</b> Slight delay, but nothing to fret about (YET!). Just means one more thing to do this weekend. But one less thing to do on the screen, which admittedly will be nice.</li>
				<li><b>Objects:</b> I kind of like the idea of incorporating a <a href="http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2013/01/jquery-flipbook-plugins.html">flipbook</a> into this somehow...</li>
			</ul>
		<h4>JOURNAL</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I just got the idea to add a timeline to it. Checking out websites for ideas jQuery plugins for this! Fun!</li>
				<li>One <a href="http://www.scratchinginfo.net/query-timeline-plugins/">site</a> with ideas for this.</li>
			</ul>

		</section>


		<section id="march1">
		<h2>March 1</h2>

		<h3>Projects: Update</h3>	
		<h4>WEDDING ALBUM PROJECT:</h4>	
			<ul>
				<li><b>Media-What I Have:</b> Based on the photos I have, the most fun elements I can work with are curled ribbon, hearts, musical keys (notes more figuratively) and bubbles. From the after party, the colors of the lamps at the Beat Brasserie are quite fun. And I think that lavendar, black, silver, and ivory will work for colors. </li>
				<li><b>Media-What I Need:</b> Definitely photos and videos from others, and copies of the vows and speeches (either written or in video format).</li>
				<li><b>Thoughts:</b> Will the photos of the guests work if they are framed in hearts? I'm thinking of those who are seated at the tables. It is a pretty simple background and would like to feature them, and not show as much of it. Somehow I'd also like to incorporate moving musical notes and bubbles...</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>JOURNAL:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I am enjoying using this as a way to not only take notes, communicate ideas, etc. but to practice some of the basics with HTML and CSS (maybe JavaScript too?).</li>
				<li>One good thing about the journal too is, if and when I have down time at work, aside from reading up on code and looking at websites, it is one of the few things class-wise I can work on!</li>
				<li>But I do need to add more of my handwritten notes, etc. to it...</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Questions!</h3>
		<p>While I definitely have to revisit this, I just tried adding a float and a clear (of some sort!) to my entry on February 20th. And I'm not sure I did this quite right! I could definitely use some help/tips with this. :) In the meantime, I can go back to a few code snippets I have and see if I can start to create my own 'cheat-sheet' about this as well. Thx!</p>
		</div><!--close div questions-->

		<h3>Tech Challenges and Successes</h3>
		<p>For once I have found the time I so desperately was seeking, and two photos in started having issues with LR (Lightroom) and/or my drive. Seriously? But it's probably easier to work on the desktop anyways... So... hmmm... I suppose I just can work on my 'TO-DO' list below for the next hour or so at least. There is always something to do!</p>

		<p>And so I decided to try to add the beginnings of a navbar and navigation links to my journal... </p>

		<h3>Resources</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>CSS: </b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">MDN General Reference</a></li>
				<li>This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Background_and_Borders/Border-image_generator">Border-image generator</a> looks like it could be fun to try.</li>

		<h3>Class Recap</h3>
		<h4>NOTES ABOUT MY PROJECT:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Idea:</b>Website featuring highlights from my friends' wedding.</li>
				<li><b>Audience:</b>Primarily for the couple, but could be shared with friends and family.</li>
				<li><b>Next Steps: </b>The next part of this is to go through the photographs that I took, and look for common themes throughout which will drive the design and look of the site. And then add any mock-ups, etc. here!</li> 
			</ul>

		<h3>Tech Challenges and Successes</h3>
		<h4>TO-DO LIST FOR THIS WEEK AND NEXT (or very soon):</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Media:</b> 1. go through photographs; 2. add ratings and tags</li> 
				<li><b>CSS:</b> 1. go through and look at everything listed on<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp"> this page</a>, and identify things to review/learn more about; 2. start by working on/reviewing layouts (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp">grids </a> for example) and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp">floats and clears</a>.</li>
				<li><b>HTML:</b> 1. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp">Iframes </a>; 2. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">Canvas</a> 
				<li><b>JavaScript:</b> 1. Just start playing with it!</li>

		<h2>February 25</h2>

		<h3>Tech Challenges and Successes</h3>
		<p><em>Why is it that in the morning I can trouble-shoot something in 10 minutes that I stared at for an hour last night?!? This only confirms my suspicion that it is a borderline detrimental to try to do anything too complicated at night...</em><p>

		<p>At least I figured out why I couldn't get my images to load into the Pomes project! I was missing a character... And that one character drove me to the depths of despair. Not really, but to the point of giving up for the evening.</p>

		<h3>Projects</h3>
			<h4>POMES:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Change map to include Gili, Bali and Thailand</li>
					<li>Quickly select about five images from each place</li>
					<li>Add Singapore to the nav</li>
					<li>Add markers</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>February 24</h2>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<p><em>How is it February 24 already? Time flies!</em><p>

		<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>While I am not necessarily one to adhere to a strict schedule, getting up at 5am (okay today 6am) seems to be a good time to work on projects that require thought and free-flowing creative energy. I tried this yesterday, and within minutes was starting to work on the first Pomes Extension at last.</p>


		<h3>Inspiration</h3>
		<p>When asked what inspired her work, Sandra Boyton's response was "Curiosity."</p>


		<h3>Tech Successes and Challenges</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Managed to open the images from Feb. 23 in Photoshop. Tried to resize them without much success. Maybe should use Lightroom still in the short-term. But it's a start at least!</li>
				<li>Successfully used Chrome Developer tools to find an error in my CSS file! (The small things...)</li>
				<li>Hmmm... I'm not sure why I can't add padding between the photos from my February 23 post. (8:30pm update: Got this to work, but not using a specific id.) Will have to revisit this and layout issues with photos and columns, etc.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3>Resources</h3>
		<p>This past January I attended two lectures at Lamont on Data Visualization: one on D3.js and the other a more general introduction. As a follow up to this, the organizers and presenters graciously sent along this <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/eabdgmde15/Handout-DataVisFundamentals2016.pdf">pdf</a> with links to various resources.</p>

		<h3>Tech Successes and Challenges - Part 2</h3>
		<p>While I realize that I'm not necessarily in love with my choice of a theme for the Pomes Extension, I think my computer may be telling me something I already knew! That and I quickly and randomly chose far more photos from fall and spring, than from summer and winter.... <em>Interesting...</em></p>
		<p>8:30pm: And I think I'm going to have to start the Pomes Extension exercise over from scratch... Maybe it's best to call it good soon... Tomorrow is another day!</p>

			<h3>Notes</h3>
		
			<p>As I am feeling a bit uninspired at the moment, I figured maybe I'd start by trying to liven up the colors here a bit with a sort of retro/beach inspired palette: turquoise, black, white, coral (#DB5844); and a sort of dusty rose (?) (#AD403F), and the fonts to Clicker Script and EB Garamond.</p>
			<p>Now all I need is a <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/ultra-lounge-sampler-mw0000611983"> little music</a> to go with it... <em>And yes, I do have this album... somewhere... I bought in Montreal once upon a time, back in days the long since past of Spider-bird Halloween costumes...</em></p>

			<h3>Pomes and Projects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Random Thought:</b> One thing that is missing is a calendar my husband just told me... So since I'm in the process of trying to pick out photos for the Pomes Extension and other projects why not make <a href="http://www.adoramapix.com/app/products/calendars/">one</a>? <i>Another side project???</i></li>

				<li><b>My Project (if wedding 'album'):</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Music, musical notes, hearts, purple, friends, family</li>
						<li>Invite: animation of two of them in a boat</li>
						<li>After the event: Beat Brasserie</li>
						<li>To do: look at wedding alburms, talk to them again about this</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><b>My Project (travel alburm):</b>	
					<ul>
						<li>Theme: traveler, explorer, old school globe... At the same time the content and the page are dynamic, so should go together...</li>
						<li>To do: Now that the files are in a remote semblance of organization (and ongoing project!) it's probably time to get to work on chosing which ones to work with...</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><b>Journal:</b>	
					<ul>
						<li>Try mixing up the typefaces</li>
						<li>Work on layout: floats, clears, scrolling</li>
						<li>Maybe change up the colors again</li>
						<li>Link back up photo from February 16. My desktop, external drive, and desktop reorganization adventure last night lent itself to a few accidenal casualties evidently...</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Tech Challenges and Successes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I started to organize my photos last night. Wish I tagged and rated them as I went along. But can start with 2016 and work backwards...</li>
				<li>Hmmm... I also think it's going to be necessary to set definitive 'work' hours at home (maybe 3am to 7am?)... or start going elsewhere to get anything done!</li>
				<li>Still need to try out the developer tools in Chrome. Maybe tomorrow... or if I can't sleep... which ever comes first...</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Design elements I like...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unique themes</li>
				<li>Overt simplicity, yet hidden complexity</li>
				<li>Creative use of typefaces</li>
				<li>Not too much of one thing (too many typefaces, too many images)</li>
				<li>Text is easy on the eyes (no squinting required!)</li>
				<li>Selective use of overlays</li>
				<li>Colors that fit the theme and mood</li>
			</ul>
