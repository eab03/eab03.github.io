          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p><em>How did a more than a week pass by? The vortex. That week that comes twice a year where my world stands still, but time keeps moving forward. And all else is forgotten. There should be a balance. There isn't. The reward?</em></p>

          <p><em>Of knowing that there truly is not where I want to be.</em></p>

          <p><em>What does this have to do with where I am at with my project? Aside from only wanting to hide under a pillow and not have to do anything out of sheer exhaustion (spiritually as well as physically and mentally). </em><p>

          <p><em>The question then becomes where do I want to be? And how to get to that point? Mindfulness. To be continued... (as the time I have set aside to make this entry is quickly fleeting!)</em></p>

          <h4>ANSWERING MILESTONE QUESTIONS IN YOUR JOURNAL:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>What did you [learn] accomplish during today's session?<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Seeing even more cool examples of how coding can be used for so many different types of outputs (i.e. the texting example and Tim's project).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>(My own question) What did you learn/accomplish this week?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>To start getting a better understanding of positioning (thanks Alec!)
                <li>To get my hearts on the page where I want them to be!
                <li>Made it through one more chapter in the Head First book.
                <li>To at last have established an understanding at home of the importance of having dedicated (mindful) time to work on this and other projects. 
             </ul>
            </li>

            <li>What do you plan to do before next week's session?
              <ul>
                <li>Keep narrowing down final choices for photos, and resize as needed. As I found it was to hard to do so on the screen, I'm going to have to print smaller versions of about 250 photos and then physically finish the layout.
                <li>General: Keep working on my self-directed lessons on JS. My goal is to finish all 12 chapters by the end of the semester.
                <li>From now two weeks: Delve into Photoshop, and isolating layers. I tried to do this a little haphazardly, but quickly realized I need to actually sit down and follow the steps to do this.
                <li>To prettify my code!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>What can we do to support you?
              <ul>
                <li>Specifically, this week to help set up the framework for the working JS code in the Flipbook (to get the images to change in the hearts. After I would like to work on a few small animations, but I won't be ready for that until the order of the photos is finished. (Ahhh!)</li>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>Was unable to make it to section this week, but spent that time reading about SVGs... However, I think it might be wise at this point to finally get some help with this project!</p>
        
        <h3>Projects</h3>

        <h4>WEDDING PROJECT:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>I managed to get two of the four hearts positioned! I would like to try to incorportate a few smaller ones that maybe just change fill color as well. But aside from choosing photos, and working on the artistic elements in Photoshop, I definitely need advice as to how to move forward with it.</li>
              </ul>

        <h4>JS:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>I'm making progress with the HeadFirst lessons, and found the informaiton I was exposed to helpful when going over the examples in class. Granted, I'm at the point about where I started to get lost with the code. But that's much progress from a few weeks ago! Still much to do!</li>
              </ul>  


        <h4>JOURNAL:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Still haven't revisited the Sticky Nav yet...</li>

            <ul>
              <li>So I managed to open Illustrator, create and export an image. Now I'm just trying to figure out how to do this properly! This <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/svg.html#enhancements">Illustrator help/SVG </a>page seems like it will be useful...</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Yay! I managed to make the SVG heart in Illustrator and put a test image behind it! It only took about 5 hours (or so)... But I do want to learn how to use Illustrator better now too!</li>
              <li>But now I need to figure out how to position the hearts and the book... <a href="https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-coordinate-systems/">Understanding SVG Coordinate Systems and Transformations (Part 1) â€” The viewport, viewBox, and preserveAspectRatio</a></li>

          <h4>NOTES:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>After doing a preliminary search about this, I have two ideas for my hearts: 1. creating the images in Photoshop; 2. creating SVGs and somehow putting the photos within. Granted I'm not quite sure what I'm doing just yet, or how to, but I kind of like the second idea for some unknown reason.</li>

          <h2>March 16</h2>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p>I finally get a moment to do a little work, and I would chose the one place without wifi. And I did not bring my hard drive with all of my photos on it either. lol.</p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <h4>FLIP BOOK:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Time to get Started!</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Tech Challenges and Successes</h3>
          <h4>JOURNAL:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>With help the sticky nav in the journal now works! I even figured out (almost!) how to get the anchors to work with the fixed header (by altering both the HTML and CSS). The top anchor, however, is a little problematic due to the proximity
              of it to the top of the page. I think by adding some content--text, a photo, clip art, or something above it--will solve that issue. Plus it will look better! My initial though was an image, but I think an inspirational quote will be better.
              Follow-up: this worked.

              <li>Well, maybe I just thought it did. After experimenting with this a little further, adding content doesn't actually address the issue. So when the page is just loaded and I click on any of the anchors the top of the div is positioned behind
                the nav bar; but on the second click it repositions the top of the div below it AND brings the navbar all the way to the top of the page. Once the navbar is at the top (OR if it was at the top to begin with) it is possible to click through
                anchors and have them all be positioned properly (with the header of the date of the last entry of each month visible). Based on my searches to solutions, I THINK that the solution to this will be a js function--perhaps with onClick but
                am not sure.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>JS:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Admittedly, my initial enthusiam with the Head First lessons waned quickly. But I'm going to go back to it, and check out the resources in the class materials. In the meantime, the class exercises and examples with commented out code are fabulously
              helpful!

          <p>I got a little distracted, and made a <a href="http://elizabethb.siteground.net/reunion_countdown/index.html">little personal project</a> which counts down the number days, etc. until a big event that is happening at work. The one exciting thing
            is that this is the first page I've built that doesn't have anything to do with a class (at least not directly)! I did save it as a repository on Github, but couldn't figure out how to make it public (in the ten minutes I have before needing
            to get ready for the day) so am hosting it on SiteGround for now. The code is based off a JavaScript based <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/build-javascript-countdown-timer-no-dependencies/">free on-line count-down calendar</a>. I modified
            the HTML and JS files slightly, and the CSS file a bit. The colors and fonts are based on Harvard's official colors, and the owl well... I wanted to add something silly but that would not be offensive to anyone.</p>

          <h4>THE PROJECT:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Things to learn how to do:</b> Amongst other things... to animate the bubbles, create the heart images, investigate examples of flip books further.</li>
            <li><b>Things to think about:</b> the different elements to incorporate (and a back-up plan if can't get all of the media).</li>
            <li><b>Things to do:</b> collect more media, but to not wait too much longer to get started on getting something on the blank pages (since they are now created!).</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>JOURNAL:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Appearance:</b> Perhaps to get the sticky nav bar to work?!? and to add some shapes to the header (perhaps even animate them?).</li>
            <li><b>Content-wise:</b> I have notes to add (general and a recap of last week's class) and would like to add some content to the 'Links' page.</li>

          <h3>Tech Successes and Challenges</h3>
          <p>As a supplementary activity I thought I might give some of the lessons in the book <a href="https://www.wickedlysmart.com/hfjs/">Head First JavaScript Programming</a> a try. So far I found the first chapter to be pretty helpful, and easy to
            follow. What is even better is that Harvard library system has a free on-line version of the text! <em>(Not that I want to be spending even more time on the screen, but so it goes!)</em></p>

          <h3>Tech Successes and Challenges</h3>
          <p>Ughh! Having more issues with both computers and just choosing photos! The iMac needs to go see a Genius and my laptop and drive are in a stand-off at the moment.</p>
          <p><em>Ke garne?</em> (A phrase in Nepali that literally translates 'What to do?' but is a bit more complex than that.) While there's little I can do about these capricious machines, I can however venture over to the Computer Lab (fun times!) at
            some point between this afternoon and this weekend, and then print out small card-sized copies of my favorite images (at ummm... an undisclosed location) and go from there. This actually has been my best approach to any project involving more
            than a few photos in the past... so I guess that says something.</p>


          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <h4>MY PROJECT, ET. AL.:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Photo Selection:</b> Slight delay, but nothing to fret about (YET!). Just means one more thing to do this weekend. But one less thing to do on the screen, which admittedly will be nice.</li>
            <li><b>Objects:</b> I kind of like the idea of incorporating a <a href="http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2013/01/jquery-flipbook-plugins.html">flipbook</a> into this somehow...</li>
            <li><b>Animation:</b> Ideas following brainstorming session... bubbles, hearts... A few examples of animation I have come across:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://bubblejumpapp.com/">Animated Bubbles</a></li>

              </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>


          <h4>JOURNAL:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I just got the idea to add a <a href="http://www.scratchinginfo.net/query-timeline-plugins/">timeline</a> to it (jQuery). More <a href="http://bashooka.com/coding/javascript-timeline-libraries/">timeline ideas</a>...(js) Fun!</li>

          <h3>Projects: Update</h3>
          <h4>WEDDING ALBUM PROJECT:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Media-What I Have:</b> Based on the photos I have, the most fun elements I can work with are curled ribbon, hearts, musical keys (notes more figuratively) and bubbles. From the after party, the colors of the lamps at the Beat Brasserie
              are quite fun. And I think that lavendar, black, silver, and ivory will work for colors. </li>
            <li><b>Media-What I Need:</b> Definitely photos and videos from others, and copies of the vows and speeches (either written or in video format).</li>
            <li><b>Thoughts:</b> Will the photos of the guests work if they are framed in hearts? I'm thinking of those who are seated at the tables. It is a pretty simple background and would like to feature them, and not show as much of it. Somehow I'd
              also like to incorporate moving musical notes and bubbles...</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>JOURNAL:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I am enjoying using this as a way to not only take notes, communicate ideas, etc. but to practice some of the basics with HTML and CSS (maybe JavaScript too?).</li>
            <li>One good thing about the journal too is, if and when I have down time at work, aside from reading up on code and looking at websites, it is one of the few things class-wise I can work on!</li>
            <li>But I do need to add more of my handwritten notes, etc. to it...</li>

            <h3>Questions!</h3>
            <p>While I definitely have to revisit this, I just tried adding a float and a clear (of some sort!) to my entry on February 20th. And I'm not sure I did this quite right! I could definitely use some help/tips with this. :) In the meantime, I
              can go back to a few code snippets I have and see if I can start to create my own 'cheat-sheet' about this as well. Thx!</p>

          <!--close div questions-->

          <h3>Tech Challenges and Successes</h3>
          <p>For once I have found the time I so desperately was seeking, and two photos in started having issues with LR (Lightroom) and/or my drive. Seriously? But it's probably easier to work on the desktop anyways... So... hmmm... I suppose I just can
            work on my 'TO-DO' list below for the next hour or so at least. There is always something to do!</p>

          <p>And so I decided to try to add the beginnings of a navbar and navigation links to my journal... </p>

          <h2>February 25</h2>

          <h3>Tech Challenges and Successes</h3>
          <p><em>Why is it that in the morning I can trouble-shoot something in 10 minutes that I stared at for an hour last night?!? This only confirms my suspicion that it is a borderline detrimental to try to do anything too complicated at night...</em>
            <p>

              <p>At least I figured out why I couldn't get my images to load into the Pomes project! I was missing a character... And that one character drove me to the depths of despair. Not really, but to the point of giving up for the evening.</p>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p><em>How is it February 24 already? Time flies!</em>
            <p>

              <h3>Thoughts</h3>
              <p>While I am not necessarily one to adhere to a strict schedule, getting up at 5am (okay today 6am) seems to be a good time to work on projects that require thought and free-flowing creative energy. I tried this yesterday, and within minutes
                was starting to work on the first Pomes Extension at last.</p>


              <h3>Inspiration</h3>
              <p>When asked what inspired her work, Sandra Boyton's response was "Curiosity."</p>


              <h3>Tech Successes and Challenges</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Managed to open the images from Feb. 23 in Photoshop. Tried to resize them without much success. Maybe should use Lightroom still in the short-term. But it's a start at least!</li>
                <li>Successfully used Chrome Developer tools to find an error in my CSS file! (The small things...)</li>
                <li>Hmmm... I'm not sure why I can't add padding between the photos from my February 23 post. (8:30pm update: Got this to work, but not using a specific id.) Will have to revisit this and layout issues with photos and columns, etc.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Resources</h3>
              <p>This past January I attended two lectures at Lamont on Data Visualization: one on D3.js and the other a more general introduction. As a follow up to this, the organizers and presenters graciously sent along this <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/eabdgmde15/Handout-DataVisFundamentals2016.pdf">pdf</a>                with links to various resources.</p>

              <h3>Tech Successes and Challenges - Part 2</h3>
              <p>While I realize that I'm not necessarily in love with my choice of a theme for the Pomes Extension, I think my computer may be telling me something I already knew! That and I quickly and randomly chose far more photos from fall and spring,
                than from summer and winter.... <em>Interesting...</em></p>
              <p>8:30pm: And I think I'm going to have to start the Pomes Extension exercise over from scratch... Maybe it's best to call it good soon... Tomorrow is another day!</p>

          <h3>Notes</h3>

          <p>As I am feeling a bit uninspired at the moment, I figured maybe I'd start by trying to liven up the colors here a bit with a sort of retro/beach inspired palette: turquoise, black, white, coral (#DB5844); and a sort of dusty rose (?) (#AD403F),
            and the fonts to Clicker Script and EB Garamond.</p>
          <p>Now all I need is a <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/ultra-lounge-sampler-mw0000611983"> little music</a> to go with it... <em>And yes, I do have this album... somewhere... I bought in Montreal once upon a time, back in days the long since past of Spider-bird Halloween costumes...</em></p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Random Thought:</b> One thing that is missing is a calendar my husband just told me... So since I'm in the process of trying to pick out photos for the Pomes Extension and other projects why not make <a href="http://www.adoramapix.com/app/products/calendars/">one</a>?
              <i>Another side project???</i></li>

            <li><b>My Project (if wedding 'album'):</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Music, musical notes, hearts, purple, friends, family</li>
                <li>Invite: animation of two of them in a boat</li>
                <li>After the event: Beat Brasserie</li>
                <li>To do: look at wedding alburms, talk to them again about this</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>My Project (travel alburm):</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Theme: traveler, explorer, old school globe... At the same time the content and the page are dynamic, so should go together...</li>
                <li>To do: Now that the files are in a remote semblance of organization (and ongoing project!) it's probably time to get to work on chosing which ones to work with...</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Journal:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Try mixing up the typefaces</li>
                <li>Work on layout: floats, clears, scrolling</li>
                <li>Maybe change up the colors again</li>
                <li>Link back up photo from February 16. My desktop, external drive, and desktop reorganization adventure last night lent itself to a few accidenal casualties evidently...</li>

            <li>Hmmm... I also think it's going to be necessary to set definitive 'work' hours at home (maybe 3am to 7am?)... or start going elsewhere to get anything done!</li>
            <li>Still need to try out the developer tools in Chrome. Maybe tomorrow... or if I can't sleep... which ever comes first...</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Thoughts</h3>
          <p>Design elements I like...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unique themes</li>
            <li>Overt simplicity, yet hidden complexity</li>
            <li>Creative use of typefaces</li>
            <li>Not too much of one thing (too many typefaces, too many images)</li>
            <li>Text is easy on the eyes (no squinting required!)</li>
            <li>Selective use of overlays</li>
            <li>Colors that fit the theme and mood</li>

            <p>In the spirit of love... wondering if another option for the final project might be to make a wedding album for my friends Chris and Tom. Since I took the photos, and can gain access to the photos/video that others took, I think I have plenty
