				<p><b>Happy Valentine's Day!</b></p>
				<p>In the spirit of love... wondering if another option for the final project might be to make a wedding album for my friends Chris and Tom. Since I took the photos, and can gain access to the photos/video that others took, I think I have plenty to work with. Plus they would LOVE it!</p>
